# A-Smarter-Way-to-Plant
Group Members: Jess Classen, Lauren Page
Description: This project is about a device that would detect when the moisture in a plant has dried up, using a soil moisture sensor, and set off an alarm 
that would beep when it is time to water it.  This device could also send the alarm to your smartphone.  This device also trains a camera on your plants so you can 
see them even when you are away.  It can show you when plants are starting to wilt if they are under watered or when you should move them inside or outside based on 
temperature changes.
