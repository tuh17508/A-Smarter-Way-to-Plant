# A-Smarter-Way-to-Plant

Group Members: Jess Classen, Lauren Page

Description: This project is about an application that would utilize a light sensor to alert the user if their plant needed to be watered more or less based on the brightness of a light on the plant. It would sense when it needed to be watered more or less and send alerts to their phone in the app.
